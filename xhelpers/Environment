Rails comes equipped with three environments: test, development, and production. The default environment for the Rails console is development:

                $ rails console
                Loading development environment
                >> Rails.env
                => "development"
                >> Rails.env.development?
                => true
                >> Rails.env.test?
                => false

As you can see, Rails provides a Rails object with an env attribute and associated environment boolean methods, so that, for example, Rails.env.test? returns true in a test environment and false otherwise.

If you ever need to run a console in a different environment (to debug a test, for example), you can pass the environment as a parameter to the console script:

                $ rails console test
                Loading test environment
                >> Rails.env
                => "test"
                >> Rails.env.test?
                => true

As with the console, development is the default environment for the local Rails server, but you can also run it in a different environment:

                $ rails server --environment production

If you view your app running in production, it wonâ€™t work without a production database, which we can create by running rake db:migrate in production:

                $ bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

(I find it confusing that the console, server, and migrate commands specify non-default environments in three mutually incompatible ways, which is why I bothered showing all three.)

By the way, if you have deployed your sample app to Heroku, you can see its environment using the heroku command, which provides its own (remote) console:

                $ heroku run console
                Ruby console for yourapp.herokuapp.com
                >> Rails.env
                => "production"
                >> Rails.env.production?
                => true

Naturally, since Heroku is a platform for production sites, it runs each application in a production environment.
